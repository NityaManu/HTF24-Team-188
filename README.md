**PetPaws**

PetPaws is a web platform developed during a hackathon to make pet adoption safer and easier. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to log in, explore available pets, apply filters to refine results, and complete an adoption application form to ensure responsible ownership.

**Features**

1. Login page to authenticate users before accessing the platform
2. Filter and search options to find pets based on breed, size, or other attributes
3. Structured pet listings with a responsive and user-friendly interface
4. Adoption application form to verify users and promote pet safety
5. Responsive design for smooth access across desktop and mobile devices

**Tech Stack**

1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Styling: Custom CSS with responsive layouts
3. Interactivity: JavaScript for dynamic features

**Motivation**

Pet adoption platforms often lack proper verification, which can compromise pet safety. PetPaws addresses this by providing a simple adoption form as a final step, ensuring that every adoption is responsible while maintaining an easy-to-use interface.

**Hackathon Context**

This project was developed in 24 hours during HacktoberFest24 CBIT.
It demonstrates how a frontend-only solution can deliver an engaging user experience while addressing real-world challenges in pet adoption.
